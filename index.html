    <h2>About Our Initiative</h2>
    <p>
      Our initiative, <strong>"Free Education for Kids"</strong>, is dedicated to empowering underprivileged children 
      through free learning opportunities. We provide tutoring in basic subjects, along with guidance in 
      critical thinking, storytelling, arts, and early coding skills.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I personally lead and coordinate these activities as a volunteer, aiming to make education accessible 
      for children who cannot afford it. So far, over 50 children in our community have benefited, developing 
      both academic skills and personal confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our long-term vision is to expand this initiative, reaching even more children, and ensuring that 
      poverty does not limit their future. Education is a right, not a privilege, and we are committed to 
      making it a reality for those in need.
