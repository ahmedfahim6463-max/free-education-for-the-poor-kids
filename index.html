    <h2>About Our Initiative</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>“Free Education for Poor Kids”</strong> initiative is a community-based program founded to provide equal educational opportunities to children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Many children cannot attend private coaching or access resources due to financial constraints. This initiative creates a welcoming environment where children receive free learning support.
    </p>
    <p>
      I personally teach core subjects like mathematics, English, and science, while also encouraging storytelling, drawing, and creative thinking exercises. I’ve also introduced basic technology and problem-solving skills. Education here is not just about books; it inspires confidence and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than fifty children have benefited so far, showing noticeable improvement in academics and personal growth. Parents in the community have expressed gratitude, witnessing their children gaining confidence, discipline, and motivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      My long-term vision is to expand this initiative, involving more volunteers and reaching additional communities. Poverty should never limit access to knowledge. By offering free education, we shape a brighter future and ensure education remains a universal right.
